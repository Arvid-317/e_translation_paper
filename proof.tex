\section{Proof}\label{sec:proof}

TODO. Here is an overview:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item We show that, with only fluents and actions, and no propositions, the models are the same.
  \item We show that adding h-proposition(s) has the same selective effect on boths sets of models. So we keep the same models.
  \item Adding t-propositions or c-propositions are trickier. We need to show the similarity of their effect (adding initiation and termination points).
\end{enumerate}
